let -> variables that can be change later
const -> variables that are unable to change
var -> original jS , can be change

console.log(typeof variable2) -> it is used to find the type of variables

a == b -> check if the a is equal to b by converting both of them to same data type. ex:5 == '5.00' return true;
a === b -> check if the a is equal to b without converting it to the same data type. ex:5 == '5.00' return false;

compression operators have the lower priorities than math operator
